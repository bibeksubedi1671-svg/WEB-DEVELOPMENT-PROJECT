    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>The web is a distributed system of hyperlinked documents and applications accessed using browsers and HTTP(S). Building for the web requires understanding three complementary layers: structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript). These layers separate concerns so teams can work in parallel — designers focus on CSS and visual systems, frontend engineers wire user interactions in JavaScript, and content/markup is handled via semantic HTML so search engines and assistive technologies can interpret the page correctly.</p>

    <p>Modern development workflows extend these fundamentals with tooling: version control (Git), package managers (npm/yarn), build tools (Webpack, Vite), type systems (TypeScript), and testing frameworks (Jest, Cypress). These tools automate repetitive tasks, enforce consistent coding style, and enable component reuse. For team projects or assignments, adopting a simple CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) ensures that tests run and deployments are repeatable, which is critical for reliability and grading consistency.</p>

    <p>Two non-negotiable concerns for professional web development are accessibility and performance. Accessibility (a11y) means using semantic HTML, proper ARIA where necessary, logical heading structure, and keyboard-friendly interactions so users with disabilities can access content. Performance involves minimizing critical resources, optimizing images, applying caching headers, and reducing render-blocking assets — practices which together improve perceived speed and UX, and often contribute to better grades or client satisfaction for projects.</p>
